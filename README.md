- [Git Textbook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
- [Chromium Source Code](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master)

(Don't read the entire Chromium Source Code; it's just a good style example to go by if you've been having difficulty with documentation or style)

## Contributing 

### What follows should be taken as a suggestion and a starting point for discussion. Nothing will be set in stone until all participants have agreed to it.

Do not directly make changes to `master` branch. At the first project meeting, we will open an issue for each of the tasks that must be completed.

Before you begin working, comment that you are doing so on the thread for that issue so that we avoid stepping on toes (this makes merging commits much easier later). Check out a branch based on the name or number of the issue you are working on.

When you have completed work, submit a pull request describing the nature of the changes you made. Commits should be more frequent than less. Do not close the issue you were working on until the pull request is merged.
